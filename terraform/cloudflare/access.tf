# Cloudflare Access in front of TBD staging (INFRA-117): dev.thebetterdecision.com is reachable only after an email
# one-time PIN sent to the owner. Staging is not indexable either (a crawler gets the login redirect).
#
# Prerequisites (owner, once; docs/runbooks.md, "Cloudflare Access on staging"): Zero Trust enabled on the account (Free
# plan, team name chosen) and the One-time PIN login method on. The workspace token needs "Access: Apps and Policies
# Write" (cloudflare-tokens, INFRA-117): apply that workspace first.
#
# Bypass is exactly what the post-deploy smoke needs (.github/scripts/post-deploy-smoke.sh, tbd-staging): GET /health
# and GET /robots.txt (served by the frontend container). Access picks the most specific path, so the bypass
# applications win over the whole-host one. Everything else, /api included, needs the login: the frontend and its API
# share the host, so one login cookie covers both.
#
# MCP OAuth bypass (INFRA-147, owner ruling 2026-10-09): an MCP client cannot pass the email PIN, so the paths it calls
# without a browser are open: /mcp, the two OAuth discovery documents and /api/v1/oauth/* (register, token, and the
# consent endpoints the page calls). An application path covers its subpaths, so
# /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp is included (and /mcp/x reaches the frontend's 404 without a login).
# The consent page /oauth/authorize is NOT bypassed: it is opened in a browser, and every page first calls
# /api/v1/auth/status (the root layout's AuthProvider), which stays behind Access. Bypassed, a browser without an Access
# session would get a page whose auth calls fail on the cross-origin Access redirect and never see the PIN prompt; kept
# behind Access, the browser gets the PIN prompt first and the page then works. For the same reason /_next/static/* is
# not bypassed either: the page cannot work without an Access session, so its assets need no bypass.
