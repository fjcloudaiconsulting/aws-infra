# Runbooks

Step-by-step procedures for the recurring changes. Why things are built this way is in
[architecture.md](architecture.md); every setting made outside git, and what breaks when it is wrong, is in
[configuration-map.md](configuration-map.md). Every command below uses the owner's kubeconfig
(`~/.kube/platform`, over NetBird) and never prints a secret value.

## Write or rotate a Kubernetes Secret

Secrets are `clusters/**/<name>.secret.yaml`, SOPS-encrypted to the cluster's age key (`.sops.yaml`). Flux decrypts
them in the cluster. Two rules decide how to work with one:

- **Encrypting a new file needs only the public key**, which is in `.sops.yaml`. This works on any laptop.
- **Editing an existing file needs the private key**, which is kept offline. Without it, `sops` fails with
  `Failed to get the data key required to decrypt the SOPS file`.

So put each value that is written or rotated on its own (an API key, a certificate) in **its own Secret file**, and
regenerate the whole file to change it. Example, a key read from a silent prompt (it stays out of shell history and
the screen):

```sh
read -rs K && printf %s "$K" | kubectl create secret generic <name> -n <namespace> \
  --from-file=<key>=/dev/stdin --dry-run=client -o yaml > clusters/platform/<dir>/<name>.secret.yaml && unset K
sops --encrypt --in-place clusters/platform/<dir>/<name>.secret.yaml
grep -c '<key>: ENC' clusters/platform/<dir>/<name>.secret.yaml   # must print 1; 0 means not encrypted: do not commit
```

Commit, push, merge. Flux applies it within a minute or two. A pod reads env at start, so after a key change run
`kubectl -n <namespace> rollout restart deploy/<name>`. To edit a multi-key Secret instead, load the offline key
first (`export SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=<path to the key file>`), then `sops edit <file>`.

## Add a public hostname for an app

Traffic path: Cloudflare (proxied, SSL mode Full strict), then Traefik on the node, then the app Service. Cloudflare
only accepts the origin if Traefik shows a Cloudflare **Origin CA** certificate for that zone.

1. **DNS:** add a proxied record in [`terraform/cloudflare/main.tf`](../terraform/cloudflare/main.tf) pointing to the
   node IP. Set the zone's SSL mode to strict there too, if this is the zone's first host on the node.
2. **Route:** add a Traefik `IngressRoute` in the app's folder under `clusters/platform/<namespace>/`, matching
   ``Host(`<host>`)`` on entryPoint `websecure`, with no `tls` block (the default TLS store serves the cert).
3. **Certificate:** an Origin CA certificate covers **one zone only**, because the Cloudflare dashboard refuses
   hostnames from another zone. Each zone has its own Secret in `kube-system`, listed in the `TLSStore default`
   ([`clusters/platform/traefik/traefik.yaml`](../clusters/platform/traefik/traefik.yaml)). Traefik picks the
   certificate by SNI.

   | Zone | Secret | Role |
   |---|---|---|
   | thebetterdecision.com | `origin-cert` | `defaultCertificate` |
   | ziftbook.com | `origin-cert-ziftbook` | `certificates` entry |

   A new host in an existing zone needs nothing here, because the certificate covers `*.<zone>`. For a **new
   zone**:
   1. Cloudflare dashboard, that zone, SSL/TLS > Origin Server > Create Certificate. Hostnames: `<zone>` and
      `*.<zone>`. Save the certificate and the private key to files outside the repo.
   2. `kubectl create secret tls origin-cert-<app> -n kube-system --cert=<crt> --key=<key> --dry-run=client -o yaml > clusters/platform/traefik/origin-cert-<app>.secret.yaml`,
      then encrypt it as in the Secret section, and delete the key file.
   3. Add `- secretName: origin-cert-<app>` under `certificates` in the TLSStore.
4. **Check** after merge and the `cloudflare` workspace apply:

```sh
kubectl -n kube-system get secret origin-cert-<app> -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 -d | openssl x509 -noout -ext subjectAltName
curl -sI https://<host> | head -1    # 526 = Traefik showed the wrong cert; 404 = no IngressRoute matched
```

## Mail (Mailgun)

Every app sends through the Mailgun HTTP API with the official SDK (`mailgun-python`), in the EU region. No SMTP,
and no in-cluster mail server.

| Environment | Sending domain | DNS |
|---|---|---|
| Every dev/staging environment of every app | `m.fjconsulting.dev`, shared | `fjdev_mail` in `terraform/cloudflare` |
| Production | `m.<appdomain>`, one per app (TBD: `m.thebetterdecision.com`) | the app zone's records in `terraform/cloudflare` |

Each environment has its **own sending key**: send-only, scoped to the domain, and revoked on its own if it leaks.
A domain's record set is MX `mxa`/`mxb.eu.mailgun.org`, SPF `include:mailgun.org`, DKIM TXT, DMARC with Mailgun
reporting, and the tracking CNAME `email.m` to `eu.mailgun.org`.

**Add a dev environment** (for example TBD staging). The domain already exists, so only two steps are needed:

1. Mailgun > Sending > Domains > `m.fjconsulting.dev` > Sending API keys > Add sending key, with the environment
   name as the description.
2. Write the key to a new Secret `<app>-mailgun` (key `api-key`) in the environment's namespace, as in the Secret
   section. Then wire the app's env to it, with the app's own setting names: Ziftbook uses `ZIF_MAILGUN_DOMAIN`,
   `ZIF_MAILGUN_REGION` (eu) and `ZIF_MAILGUN_API_KEY` from `secretKeyRef ziftbook-mailgun/api-key` (see
   [`clusters/platform/ziftbook-staging/worker.yaml`](../clusters/platform/ziftbook-staging/worker.yaml)).

**Add a production domain:**

1. Add the domain in Mailgun (EU).
2. Copy its records into `terraform/cloudflare` (the TBD block is the model).
3. Merge and apply, then verify the domain in Mailgun.

If Mailgun's "automatic setup" for Cloudflare was used instead, the records already exist outside Terraform. Adopt
them with `import` blocks (id `<zone_id>/<record_id>`, from the Cloudflare API) rather than deleting them, as
INFRA-47 did.

The domain `m.fjconsulting.dev` is shared, so Mailgun webhooks on it deliver every dev app's events to every
registered URL. Each app tags its messages and ignores events for messages it did not send.

**Check:**

```sh
# Use DoH: local dig can be intercepted (NetBird DNS) and answer empty even when the records exist.
curl -s -H 'accept: application/dns-json' 'https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?name=m.fjconsulting.dev&type=MX'   # mxa/mxb.eu.mailgun.org
kubectl -n <namespace> exec deploy/<name> -- sh -c 'test -n "$<APP>_MAILGUN_API_KEY" && echo set'
```

Then check that the Mailgun dashboard shows the domain as verified. A lookup made before the records existed is
cached as "no record" for up to 30 minutes (the zone's SOA minimum), so Mailgun can show MX unverified for that
long after the apply. Press Verify again later; nothing needs changing.
