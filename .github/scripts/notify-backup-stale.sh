# ⚠ SEPARATE DEDUPE BUCKET from the smoke-failure and deploy-drift notifiers,
# and it deliberately duplicates ~15 lines of `gh issue` plumbing rather than
# sharing them. A stale backup and a failed deploy are independent conditions
# that can legitimately be open at the same time; collapsing the buckets would
# let one alarm silence the other. The shared code would sit on the exact path
# whose failure mode is silence during an incident.

The scheduled backup freshness probe did not find a healthy off-host backup.

**Verdict:** \`${VERDICT}\`

\`\`\`
${DETAIL}
\`\`\`

Probe run: ${RUN_URL}

---

**What this means.** The nightly dumps (\`tbd-mysql/\` and \`ziftbook-postgres/\` from the k3s \`db-backup\` CronJob) are
the durability floor, and the copy in S3 is the only part that survives losing
the machine. A \`stale\` verdict means at least one night has not completed end
to end. A \`could-not-run\` verdict means the probe could not answer the question
at all, which is not evidence of health.

**Where to look.**
1. \`kubectl -n data get jobs\` and the failed job's logs.
2. Whether the \`FlamaCorp/tbd-backups\` workspace has been applied.

⚠ Do not silence this by widening the probe's thresholds.
