#   exit 0  fresh   -- last night's backup is present, complete and plausible
#   exit 1  STALE   -- missing, too old, incomplete, or implausibly small
#   exit 2  could not run -- malformed input, missing tools
#
# ⚠ STDIN RATHER THAN CALLING AWS ITSELF, so the fences can drive every branch
# with fixture listings and no AWS account. A probe that can only be exercised
# against a healthy live bucket proves nothing about its unhealthy paths, which
# are the only paths that matter.
#
# ⚠ WHY THIS RUNS OFF THE DROPLET. An alert emitted by the machine being backed
# up cannot fire when that machine is gone, or when cron never ran -- which is
# exactly the disaster this backup exists for. Silence is the signal, and only
# an external observer can read it.
#
# ⚠ "SOME OBJECT EXISTS" IS A FAIL-OPEN CHECK. A bucket full of week-old dumps
# satisfies it forever. Hence: the MANIFEST must be present (it is uploaded
# last, so its presence is the only proof the night completed end to end), it
# must be recent, and the dump must clear a size floor.
